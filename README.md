Swift Student Challenge 2025 Submission
Daily Panna - named after Indian traditional way of daily expense tracking. Other app available had a lot of distractions and did not allow the user to personalise the categories. This app has a clean and minimal interface. It completes the job for the user to add expense as per the categories added by the user and also generates a report of the total expenses and category total expenses to make it easier for the user
